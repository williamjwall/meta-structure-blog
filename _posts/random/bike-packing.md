#### Rode from San Francisco to Portland, Oregonâ€”on a whim.

- 783 miles  
- 42,100 feet of climbing  
- 14 days  

I started on the north side of San Francisco with a new bike I had just bought and headed north, figuring it out as I went. Picked up supplies and bikepacking gear along the way. The route mostly followed the coastline, and I camped fairly randomly.

The stretch from Fort Bragg, CA to Crescent City, CA was probably the my favorite.
